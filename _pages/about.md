Hi! I am a final-semester PhD student in computer science at NYU Tandon with a passion for teaching, and my advisor is Professor [Damon McCoy](http://damonmccoy.com). 
My pronouns are she/her. 
My main research interests are cybersecurity, ethics, and social bias in machine learning! Lately I have been focusing on online harassment. 
I strongly believe that the most efficient path to ethical tech is to have computer/data scientists who reflect the population that their products are designed to affect. 
Please feel free to reach out to me to talk about teaching, ethical computing, or online harassment!
